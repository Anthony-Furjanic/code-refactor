# code-refactor

## description
while working on this project I edited out all div tags and replaced with more accurate and appropriate semantic tags.  I changed the coding on all images.  I used section tags to notate and discern between the head, middle sections, and side bar.  I used article to notate each individual block of information and I adjusted the CSS to make all tags and links work as they perviously did but with cleaner code. 


## objective

refactor entire site using semantic tags
